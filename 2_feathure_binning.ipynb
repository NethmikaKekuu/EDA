    "1. Non-linear relationship with target\n",
    "-Binning can help capture non-linear patterns that a linear models might miss\n",

    "2. Skewed distribution\n",
    "-Binning can smooth out skew and reduce the effct of extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpretability is key\n",
    "-Easier for business users to understand \"age 18-25\" than \"age=23\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model is prone to overfitting \n",
    "-Binning reduces granularity -> fewer splits -> less overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Need to reduce cardinality \n",
    "-Helps when a numeric column has too many unique values turned nto few bis\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Sparse or noisy data\n",
    "- Binning can group rare or noisy values to improve signal strenght"
